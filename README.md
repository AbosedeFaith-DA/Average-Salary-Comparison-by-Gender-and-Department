# Average-Salary-Comparison-by-Gender-and-DepartmentAverage employee salary (since 1990)

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of salary distributions by gender across departments within specified salary ranges, as defined by user inputs. This analysis utilizes a dynamic SQL stored procedure to retrieve the average salaries of male and female employees per department, constrained to a user-defined salary band. The findings are visualized in Tableau through a dual bar chart, providing a clear comparison of gender-based salary distribution across departments. This project aims to support informed assessments of compensation structures and foster data-driven strategies to promote pay equity within the organization.
# Dataset used

# Question
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.

Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.

  # Project Insights
Consistent Salary Trends Across Departments:
The chart indicates that average salaries for male and female employees have remained relatively stable across departments, with limited fluctuations within the specified salary range.

Gender-Based Salary Comparison:
In most departments, there is a consistent pattern where male employees tend to have a slightly higher average salary than female employees, although the difference is often minimal.
Departments such as Finance, Sales, and Marketing show some of the more noticeable differences in average salaries between genders, with male employees earning slightly more on average.
Departmental Parity Observed in Certain Areas:
Some departments, like Customer Service and Quality Management, show close parity between male and female salaries, highlighting areas where the company may have achieved or is approaching gender pay equality.

# Final Conclusion
This analysis offers valuable insights into salary distributions by gender across departments. It suggests that while there is generally alignment between male and female salaries, specific departments may warrant further investigation to ensure that any discrepancies are understood and addressed where necessary. This level of analysis can support organizational efforts toward equitable compensation practices and aid in fostering a fair workplace culture.
