# Average-Salary-Comparison-by-Gender-and-Department

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of salary distributions by gender across departments within specified salary ranges, as defined by user inputs. This analysis utilizes a dynamic SQL stored procedure to retrieve the average salaries of male and female employees per department, constrained to a user-defined salary band. The findings are visualized in Tableau through a dual bar chart, providing a clear comparison of gender-based salary distribution across departments. This project aims to support informed assessments of compensation structures and foster data-driven strategies to promote pay equity within the organization.

# Question
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.

Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
